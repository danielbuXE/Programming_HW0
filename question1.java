//	The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any
//	positive integer n and apply the following algorithm:
//	The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied,
//	all positive integers will eventually reach 1. For example, if n = 35, the
//	sequence is
//	35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
//	Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates this
//	sequence in the child process. The starting number will be provided
//	from the command line. For example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on
//	the command line, the child process will output 8, 4, 2, 1. Because the
//	parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be
//	necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke
//	the wait() call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting
//	the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure that a positive
//	integer is passed on the command line.
