//	Write a multithreaded program that outputs prime numbers. This
//	program should work as follows: The user will run the program and
//	will enter a number on the command line. The program will then create
//	a separate thread that outputs all the prime numbers less than or equal
//	to the number entered by the user. (You can use Java or C)
